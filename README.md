# Biotool-collections
A collection of tools for daily bioinformatics

## FASTQ
* [MutScan](https://github.com/OpenGene/MutScan) - Detect and visualize target mutations by scanning FastQ files directly.
* [pecheck](https://github.com/OpenGene/pecheck) - check paired-end FASTQ data integrity.

## BAM 
* [VariantBam](https://github.com/walaj/VariantBam) - Filtering and profiling of next-generational sequencing data using region-specific rules.

* [deepTools](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools) - Tools to process and analyze deep sequencing data.
* [genescore](https://github.com/OpenGene/gencore) - An efficient tool to remove sequencing duplications and eliminate sequencing errors by generating consensus reads.
* [MrBam](https://github.com/OpenGene/MrBam) - For a given mutation, query its mutated reads from a BAM, merge the reads by positions and give the unique count.
